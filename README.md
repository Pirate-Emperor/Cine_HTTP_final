# Cine_HTTP_final

Developed by Pirate-Emperor, Cine_HTTP_final is a Python project that demonstrates the implementation of HTTP protocols to interact with web resources, specifically in the context of a movie application.

## Features

- **HTTP Requests**: Uses Python to make HTTP GET and POST requests to interact with web resources.
- **Data Parsing**: Extracts and processes data from API responses, such as JSON or XML.
- **API Interaction**: Demonstrates how to interact with a movie-related API for fetching movie details, showtimes, and reviews.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling mechanisms for HTTP requests and responses.
- **User-friendly Output**: Formats the fetched data in a readable manner for user consumption.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., requests, json, etc.)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Cine_HTTP_final.git
cd Cine_HTTP_final
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will make HTTP requests to a movie-related API and display the fetched data in a user-friendly format.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the Python script in the `src` directory. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Adding support for more movie-related APIs.
- Implementing a caching mechanism to reduce API calls.
- Incorporating a user interface for an interactive experience.
- Expanding the functionality to include movie recommendations and ratings.
